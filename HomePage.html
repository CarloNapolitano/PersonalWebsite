		Welcome to my portfolio-website where I get to showcase all works that I have completed to this day that involve the use of HTML and CSS coding. I'm very glad that you have come here to visit my website. I certainly can't show-off my talents if there is no one to see them! Now, this is just the Home page but if you wish to see more about me or see what I have made so far, use my state-of-the-art "Navigation Bar" at the top of this page to direct yourself to where you want to go!

			Thanks for visiting my webpage! If you have any suggestions for my website about what I can do to improve it, be sure to send me a message. Hope you come back soon!
