		Welcome to my About page. Now to start off, this website was created as a project assignment for the New York Code+Design Academy Summer Code Camp. Me and many other students had to design and style our very own website that would serve as our portfolios that showcase our completed works and talents. I am the creator of this website, Carlo Napolitano, and you probably want to know more about me. Obviously. Who doesn't?

		There is a picture of me to the left if you havn't noticed and I guess I'll talk more about myself. Currently I am a highschool student attending at Manhattan Center for Science and Mathematics or MCSM for short. I moved to New York in 2015 after living in Florida all my life and I am also an Hispanic from Venezuela. I am a rising senior and I aim to become a Sound Engineer. This basically means I'll be making sound devices like speakers, microphones, headphones, and etc. Not remastering sound in studios for music-production companies. For my hobbies I like to
		<ul>
			<li class="secondli">
				Play video games. Preferably RPGs and MOBAs.Vainglory especially.
			</li>
			<li class="secondli">
				Read Graphic-Novels such as Manga.
			</li>
			<li class="secondli">
				Hang out with my friends at the park.

		</ul>

			I'm a pretty simple person as you can see here. I hope this webpage helped you learn more about who I am.
